<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enter addresses, location names or business names into the search box to see which Minneapolis or St. Paul neighborhood it lands within.</li>
<li>If the marker lands near an edge, zoom in further to clarify where it's located.</li>
<li>Also useful for figuring whether a Minneapolis or St. Paul address is actually within one of those respective cities â€“ it's not always the case!</li>
<li>The search box autocomplete encompasses all of Minnesota and places near its borders, so some autocomplete results fall outside the Twin Cities.</li>
<li>Note the changed Minneapolis neighborhood names around Bde Maka Ska when hovering the cursor over them. The basemap still has some of the older names, which is an OpenStreetMap thing I can't solve.</li>
<li>It's helpful to remember the difference between neighborhoods and community groups. For instance: there's a difference between the Longfellow community, which includes Seward, and the Longefellow neighborhood south of Seward.</li>
